{"name":"Flaskcbv","tagline":"Now you can use Flask with CBV approach","body":"### Welcome to FlaskCBV Project!\r\nA view is a callable which takes a request and returns a response. This can be more than just a function, and FlaskCBV provides an example of some classes which can be used as views. These allow you to structure your views and reuse code by harnessing inheritance and mixins. There are also some generic views for simple tasks which weâ€™ll get to later, but you may want to design your own structure of reusable views which suits your use case. For full details, see the class-based views reference documentation.\r\n\r\n### Basic examples\r\nFlaskCBV provides base view classes which will suit a wide range of applications. All views inherit from the View class, which handles linking the view in to the URLs, HTTP method dispatching and other simple features. RedirectView is for a simple HTTP redirect, and TemplateView extends the base class to make it also render a template.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
